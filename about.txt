I've taken Coursera's Machine Learning Class and I'm currently taking Professor Ng's Deep Learning course.

I would post my course work but the TOA is that we don't post course work to keep it fair.

Here I'm working on personal projects independent of the course.  My time is spent between machine learning and data science.
